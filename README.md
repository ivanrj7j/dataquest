# Welcome to DataQuest: The Participant Guide 🚀

**Predict the future. Pitch the solution.**

Welcome to **DataQuest**, hosted by GDG! This isn't your typical hackathon where the only thing that matters is a model's accuracy score. DataQuest is about **Data Storytelling**.

In the real world, data scientists don't just write code; they analyze data to find hidden trends, build models to predict what happens next, and—most importantly—explain their findings to stakeholders so they can make smart decisions. That is your mission.

## 🗓️ Important Dates

* **Competition Starts (Dataset Revealed):** February 22

* **Competition Ends (Submission Deadline):** February 24

You have exactly 3 days to explore the data, build your model, and craft your story. You can work at your own pace throughout this window.

## 🎯 The Challenge: How it Works

When the competition begins on Feb 22, you will receive a **Dataset** and a **Business Scenario** (e.g., "You are a data scientist at a retail company, and sales are dropping. Figure out why and predict next month's numbers").

Your task is broken down into three main steps:

1. **Clean & Explore:** Dig into the data. Handle missing values, find outliers, and create visualizations to understand the current situation.

2. **Predict:** Build a machine learning model to make a prediction based on the prompt.

3. **Pitch (The Story):** Write a clear, concise Executive Summary within your notebook. **Make sure to present like you are giving a solution to a company CEO who is dealing with customer churn.** Explain what your model found, why it matters, and what specific business decisions they should make to retain their customers.

**Remember: Narrative over Numbers.** A simple model with a brilliant, clear explanation will score higher than a highly complex model with zero explanation.

## 📤 Submission Guidelines

At the end of the competition, you will submit your work via this [**Google Form**](https://forms.gle/eMrXC6u6EPhVDrqJ8).

**What you need to submit:**

* A link to your **Google Colab Notebook**, **Kaggle Notebook**, or **GitHub Repository**. *(Make sure the link is set to public/anyone with the link can view!)*

* **(Optional but Highly Recommended):** A 2-minute video pitch explaining your findings to the "Executive Board."

## 📚 Preparation Resources & Tutorials

Whether you are a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, here are some of the best free resources to help you prepare for DataQuest.

### 1. Tools of the Trade (Where to code)

You don't need to install anything heavy on your computer. Run everything in the cloud:

* [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/)**:** Free Jupyter notebooks hosted by Google.

* [**Kaggle Notebooks**](https://www.kaggle.com/code)**:** Great if you want to explore community datasets alongside your code.

### 2. Data Manipulation (Pandas)

Before you can analyze data, you have to clean it. `pandas` is the ultimate Python library for this.

* **Watch:** [Pandas Data Science Tutorial by Keith Galli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) (Excellent real-world walkthrough).

* **Watch:** [Python Pandas Tutorial by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSLQ7uyfNIItZf404-TviaeM01pnebr5K) (Great for foundational basics).

* **Read:** [Kaggle's Pandas Micro-Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) (Interactive, takes about 2 hours).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

This is where you find the "Story." Use libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`.

* **Watch:** [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python by Ken Jee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWgg4w1SpJ8) (See how a pro approaches a fresh dataset).

* **Watch:** [Data Visualization in Python (Seaborn) by Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YWwU-gJI5U).

### 4. Machine Learning & Predictions (Scikit-Learn)

Don't be intimidated by ML! For this competition, basic predictive models are perfectly fine.

* **Watch:** [StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) (The absolute best channel for understanding *how* ML algorithms work visually without overwhelming math). Start with his "Linear Regression" and "Decision Trees" videos.

* **Watch:** [Machine Learning for Everybody by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg) (A comprehensive crash course).

* **Read:** [Kaggle's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning).

### 5. Data Storytelling

This is what will win you the competition. How do you translate code into business value?

* **Watch:** [Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EMW7io4rSI) (A brilliant talk on how to present data to business leaders).

* **Tip:** In your notebook, use **Markdown cells** extensively. Don't just leave code cells stacked on top of each other. Write headers like *"Why I chose this model"*, *"What this graph tells us"*, and *"Final Recommendations"*.

Good luck, and get ready to tell an amazing story with data!
